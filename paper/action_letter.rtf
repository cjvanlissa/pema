G. Thompson & Higgins, 2002). This does not resolve the problem, however, as failing to consider a moderator does not mean that it is irrelevant. Instead, moderators ought to be selected based on their theoretical or empirical relevance for the studied effect.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\lnbrkrule\li132\fi7\ri102\qj\sl249\slmult1\sb79\f0\fs20\b0\expnd0\expndtw0\charscalex100 One\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 approach\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 is\expnd6\expndtw28  \expnd0\expndtw0 to\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 select\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 variables\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 on\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 theoretical\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 grounds.\expnd16\expndtw80  \expnd0\expndtw0 An\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 important\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 caveat\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 is\expnd5\expndtw27  \expnd0\expndtw0 that\expnd6\expndtw28  \expnd0\expndtw0 theories that\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 describe\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 phenomena\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 at\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 the\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 level\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 of\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 individual\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 units\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 of\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 analysis\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 do\expnd4\expndtw22  \expnd0\expndtw0 not\expnd5\expndtw23  \expnd0\expndtw0 necessarily\expnd5\expndtw23  \expnd0\expndtw0 generalize to the study level.
